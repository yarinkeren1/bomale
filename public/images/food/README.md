# Food Images for BOMA'LE Carousel

This directory contains food images for the BOMA'LE website carousel.

## Note
The actual food images have been removed from this repository to reduce file size for GitHub hosting. 

## Images that should be here:
- Baklava boureka images (various angles and closeups)
- Cheese boureka images (regular, split, packaging views)
- Eggplant boureka images
- Nutella boureka images
- Potato boureka images
- Side dishes and complements (egg, Israeli salad, pickles & olives, etc.)
- Sauces and condiments (schug, tchina, resek, whipped cream)

## To add images back:
1. Add the JPG files to this directory
2. Ensure they are optimized for web (compressed, reasonable file sizes)
3. Consider using Git LFS for large image files

## Current placeholder:
The website will handle missing images gracefully by showing placeholder content or skipping image carousel sections.
